I am a postdoctoral researcher studying space plasmas, particularly in planetary magnetospheres. I work at the Space Physics Group ([SpacePhysics@Princeton](https://spacephysics.princeton.edu/)) at Princeton University, which I joined in 2022. Prior to that I was at the University of Michigan's Climate and Space Science and Engineering (CLASP) department where I completed my PhD dissertation on global modeling of Jupiter's magnetosphere. 

My particular expertise is in giant planet magnetospheres like that of Jupiter, and its interaction with moons like Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. This field is somewhat at the intersection of space plasma physics and planetary science and benefits from measurements made in situ by spacecraft. These in-situ measurements not only provide information about the magnetospheres and space environment, but also provide a lot of information about the planet itself.  

I have some past experience with large-scale numerical simulations, but nowadays I spend most of my time analyzing plasma data from instruments onboard the Juno spacecraft.
