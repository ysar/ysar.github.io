<br />
I am a researcher specializing in space plasma physics and planetary
magnetospheres.  I earned a PhD in 2021 from the University of Michigan. From
2022 to Jan 2025, I was a postdoc in the Space Physics group at Princeton
University.  For my research, I specialize in empirical and observational 
studies of plasma processes, as measured by instruments onboard spacecraft.
