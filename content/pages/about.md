I am a postdoctoral researcher studying planetary magnetospheres. I work at the Space Physics Group ([SpacePhysics@Princeton](https://spacephysics.princeton.edu/)) at Princeton University, which I joined in 2022. Prior to that I was at the University of Michigan's Climate and Space Science and Engineering (CLASP) department where I completed my PhD dissertation on global modeling of Jupiter's magnetosphere. My expertise is in giant planet magnetospheres like that of Jupiter, and its interaction with moons like Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. This field is somewhat at the intersection of space plasma physics and planetary science and benefits from measurements made in situ by spacecraft. 

I use Python for data processing and analysis and am experimenting with Rust for high-performance needs. 

Personal Info - I was born in central India and grew up near Mumbai. I have various interests outside of work, but most of all I like spending time hiking with my wife in the remote wilderness.
