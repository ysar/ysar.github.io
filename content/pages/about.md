Welcome to my personal website.  

I am a researcher studying space plasma physics and planetary
magnetospheres.  I earned a PhD in Space Science in 2021 from the University 
of Michigan and continued there as a postdoc until Jun 2022.  From Jul 2022 to 
Jan 2025, I was a postdoc in the Space Physics group at Princeton University.

I specialize in studies of Jupiter's magnetosphere.
While at Michigan, I used global magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study its 
dynamics. Towards the end of my PhD, I used magnetometer data to study magnetic 
reconnection.  At Princeton, my collaborators and I used data from the 
plasma and high-energy particle detectors to search for the Europa neutral 
torus.  We identified strange plasma distributions in the wakes of the Galilean 
moons.  We also found evidence of resonance between a planet's rotation and 
particles trapped by the planet's magnetic field.
